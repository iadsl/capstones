- **Master Project by [Nathan Katzman](../_pages/about_nathan-katzman.md)**

MelodyMaker is a cutting-edge project that merges human creativity with the power of artificial intelligence. Designed as an interactive system, it allows users to click on virtual piano keys to create a starting sequence, which the system then extends by generating a seamless melody continuation using **MusicVAE**. This project highlights the practical application of machine learning in the creative domain of music generation, offering an engaging and intuitive experience.

### About MusicVAE

**MusicVAE** is a state-of-the-art variational autoencoder model for generating and interpolating musical sequences. By learning a latent space for music, it enables the creation of smooth transitions between melodies or the continuation of user-provided sequences. MusicVAE is a powerful tool at the intersection of artificial intelligence and the creative arts.
