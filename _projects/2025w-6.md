- **Research Project by [Nate Miller](../../students/) and [Trevor Ouma](../../students/)**
  
**PLATO** is a research project focused on applying **Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Machine Learning (ML)** techniques to analyze **philosophical texts**, with a primary focus on **Platoâ€™s *Republic***, as well as works from **Aristotle, Kant, and other classical philosophers**.

**Objectives**
The goal of PLATO is to develop a **computational framework** that enables:
- Automated theme extraction from philosophical texts using **BERTopic**.
- Structured argument detection using **RoBERTa-based argument mining**.
- Argument complexity modeling through **machine learning-based feature analysis**.
- Statistical evaluation of reasoning structures in philosophical narratives.

**Key Features**
- Thematic Analysis: Extracts dominant topics and themes in classical philosophical texts.
- Argument Mining: Detects **claims, premises, and conclusions** in philosophical arguments.
- Complexity Modeling: Quantifies the **complexity of reasoning structures** in text.
- Statistical Insights: Explores relationships between **theme complexity and argument structure**.
