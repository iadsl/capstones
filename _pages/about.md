This website showcases the projects undertaken by undergraduate and graduate students under my supervision. These projects demonstrate creativity, analytical rigor, practical applications, and technical expertise across a variety of fields in data science, analytics, computer science, and web application design.

**About the Capstone Experience**

The capstone or masterâ€™s project represents a culmination of academic and research efforts, enabling students to:
- Apply theoretical knowledge to solve real-world challenges.
- Develop technical and problem-solving skills through hands-on research.
- Showcase their expertise in data science, analytics, computing, and web application development.
- Explore the integration of advanced web technologies and frameworks to design, build, and deploy interactive and scalable web applications.
- Demonstrate proficiency in front-end and back-end development, user experience (UX) design, and web-based data visualization.

These projects reflect the students' ability to combine theoretical foundations with practical implementations, resulting in innovative solutions that address modern challenges in their respective fields.
